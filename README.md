**Bot Discord developped in 2024 by Mithanne**

Help to use the bot :
- Change the discord token by yours by going into the config.json and settings your token bot (you can find it by going on the website discord developper portal, and creating an application, then a bot, and then taking this token.
- You can change the prefix if you want too (in config.json)
- Once it is good, launch your bot, and set after your discord log channel with the command setsalon
